## Plugin Compatibility Matrix

VST instruments with audio inputs are a bit of a rare one. Once upon a time a sound generating plugin was thought to never need audio inputs. Only effects needed ins and outs.

Long story short, using VMPC2000XL as a sampler, recording new sounds with it, doesn't work properly in all DAWs. Maybe some things will improve as my understanding of it does, but for now the below matrices apply.

**Supported features**

* MIDI note on/off input and output
* Multiple instances
* MIDI CLOCK slave synchronization
* Any MIDI Controller (1-127) controls the slider
* Persist full state including samples to DAW projects and programs

**Not implemented**:

* Musical position synchronization
* Button to MIDI mapping

This will also serve as a rough indication of VMPC2000XL's MIDI and other control protocol support for the time being, which indeed is very crude and limited compared to the original.
